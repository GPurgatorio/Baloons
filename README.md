# Final-PI
It's a simple Worms-like game in Javascript for an exam in @Pisa University.
The exam consists in creating whatever application we wish in whatever programming language we choose, that's why I've chosen to mimic one of my favourite childhood's game.

The game is like a side-project to me, even if the part for the exam is done I wish I could every now and then spend a bit more time on improving it, so suggestions and/or requests are appreciated :)

In the info, at the start of the game, you'll find everything you need to know on how to play, but TL;DR is:
  - Graphic is intentionally simple because I've chosen to use Vanilla Javascript (no extern libraries).
  - Team Deathmatch (no teams at the moment, I'm kinda lazy about it).
  - 3 Weapons. I'll add more once I'm done with other exams.
  - The game is Height-only, which will cause many weird behaviours if not fully understood. If you don't understand this sentence, you       might understand it if I say "The world you see, the whole map, isn't mapped in a structure. I only have an array of heights".
  
The code will be released once I've finished the exam so I can prevent weird clones that would definitely not help the not-very-smart guys who clones this.
