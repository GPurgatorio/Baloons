# Final-PI
It's gonna be a simple Worms-like game in Javascript for an exam in @Pisa University. It's gonna take a while, I have many other projects at the moment and as you can see I don't even have time to refactor my code!

At the moment it's at maybe 25% of the final work, but you can already move turn by turn any number of Baloons you wish to make in that terrain and edit it as you please!

TO-DO:
1) Implement weapons and weapon-affiliate stuff (projectiles, etc)
2) Fix weird bug about world-editing
  2.1) Replace world editing with something that approximates a circle to avoid the rough edit
3) Maybe instead of drawing every line drawing the lines between all the heights and paint below?
4) Implement teams
5) Set timer to be something useful instead of a simple debugging tool
6) Update every-ball every-frame without losing that much frame
7) as usual: gain efficiency for frame-rate :D
